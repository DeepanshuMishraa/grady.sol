## User Story
```
As a student , I want to track my grades for each subject in a simple way so that i can easily manage my academics and improve my performance.

I can add new grades for each subject whenever i want to update my grades.

Incase my grades are incorrect and i get them revaluated , I can update my grades accordingly.

If i need to drop a subject , I can remove it from my grade tracker.
